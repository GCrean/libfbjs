NOTES:
* NodeString expressions are implemented poorly right now. Instead of parsing
  what's in the string we just grab the raw contents from code. This was just
  a hack because I didn't feel like writing the state machine to convert \x,
  \u, \0, etc into bytes.
* There will be a memory leak when you attempt to parse a program with a syntax
  error in it. This is because the authority of freeing allocated nodes is left
  to the parent node. The problem is that the allocated child nodes aren't added
  to the AST until the very last step. Thus, when a ParseException is raised the
  allocated nodes are lost since they never became associated with a managed
  node.
